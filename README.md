# flightcalculator
Simple flight time and distance calculator between any two airports in the world. Created for the AP Computer Science Principles Create Task. All modules used are already included in Python 3.6. 

For this to work, you must obtain a working CHECKWX API Key. This can be found at 
https://www.checkwx.com/api/newkey.

API keys from CheckWX are free, but are limited to 2000 calls per month(more than enough for this project).
